This is a simple stub driver for testing BIND dynamic back-ends.
To use it, simply do:

$ make
$ su -c 'cp stub_driver.so* /usr/lib/'

or

$ su -c 'cp stub_driver.so* /usr/lib64/'

Then, put something like this into your /etc/named.conf:

dynamic-db "meh" {
	library "stub_driver.so.1.0.0";
	arg "first_arg 1 2 3 hello";
	arg "second_arg meh";
};

The ``library'' statement points to the shared object that is the back-end.
You can specify a full path instead, if you like.
The ``arg'' statement provides an argument to the back-end. In case of the
stub driver, it will only list them in the logs.
